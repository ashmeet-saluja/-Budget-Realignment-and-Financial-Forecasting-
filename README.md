## 🛠 **Setup & Installation**  

### **1️⃣ Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed along with the following dependencies. You can install them using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2️⃣ Dataset**  
- The dataset includes **historical budget allocations, revenue data, and external economic indicators** spanning over **20+ years**.  
- Issues like **missing values, duplicate records, non-standard formats, and inconsistent categories** are introduced to simulate real-world scenarios.  

---

## 🔄 **Workflow**  

### 📌 **1. Data Collection & Cleaning**  
- Collects **historical budget, actual spending, revenue trends, inflation, and GDP growth** data.  
- Handles issues such as:
  - **Duplicate records** removal  
  - **Standardizing formats** for currency, dates, and categories  
  - **Consolidating categories** to maintain consistency  

### 📌 **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Identifies **trends, anomalies, and correlations** between spending and efficiency.  
- Uses **visualizations** (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, time-series graphs).  

### 📌 **3. Forecasting Future Spend Efficiency**  
- Predicts future **Spend Efficiency** using **Linear Regression** based on:  
  - **Revenue**  
  - **Inflation Rate**  
  - **GDP Growth Rate**  
- Uses **ARIMA/Prophet models** to forecast future values for revenue and external factors.  

### 📌 **4. Budget Optimization**  
- Uses **predicted spend efficiency** to recommend **budget reallocations** for optimal performance.  
- Simulates different budget **scenarios** and their impact.
